  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,764 out of  69,120    3%
    Number used as logic:                    2,758 out of  69,120    3%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,555
      Number using O5 output only:              90
      Number using O5 and O6:                  113
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         6
  Number of route-thrus:                       100
    Number using O6 output only:                96

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   910 out of  17,280    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,828
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,313 out of   2,828   46%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  64 out of   2,828    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,451 out of   2,828   51%
    Number of unique control sets:              47
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              37 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
